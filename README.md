### [Caesar's Cipher](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/caesars-cipher)

## PROJECT STATEMENT
One of the simplest and most widely known _ciphers_ is a _Caesar cipher_, also known as a _shift cipher_.  In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the [ROT13](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-code-the-caesar-cipher-an-introduction-to-basic-encryption-3bf77b4e19f7/) cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places.  Thus `A <-> N`, `B <-> O` and so on.

Write a function which takes [ROT13](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-code-the-caesar-cipher-an-introduction-to-basic-encryption-3bf77b4e19f7/) encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

All letters will be uppercase.  Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.
